## 🎯 About Me

I’m Felipe Borges, a 23-year-old Medical Physics student at UFCSPA — Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre.

My background in Medical Physics strengthened my analytical thinking, problem-solving and scientific rigor — skills I now apply directly to software engineering. Over the past years, I’ve built full-stack products, dashboards, design systems and data-driven applications that combine clean UI, strong architecture and real-world functionality.

Currently, I’m part of a research project focused on developing and validating a machine learning model based on MRI radiomic features to predict tumor progression in patients with acoustic neuroma under initial observation. In parallel, I’ve been expanding my technical expertise in JavaScript, React, Node.js, TypeScript, and AI integration.

I learn fast, I enjoy working on challenging problems, and I’m motivated by building reliable, elegant and scalable digital solutions. I’m currently seeking a full-stack or frontend developer role where I can contribute, grow and work alongside a strong engineering team.

I’m fluent in English, currently learning German, and can read and understand Spanish.
